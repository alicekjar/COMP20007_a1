# COMP20007 - Assignment 1

This assignment was completed as an assessment piece for COMP20007 (Design of Algorithms). It consists of two parts, each of which can be broken down into several sub-problems.

Both parts 1 and 2 received full marks upon grading.

## Part 1

### Problem 1A
Provided pseudocode for Jarvis' March algorithm was used to produce a program which returns a convex hull for a given set of points.

- **Input:** A .txt containing the number of points (first line) and the coordinates of each of the points (all subsequent lines)

- **Output:** A .txt file containing the coordinates of all points in the convex hull, listen clockwise (first line), followed by anti-clockwise (second line).


### Problem 1B
Same functionality as Problem 1A, but using Graham's Scan algorithm.


### Problem 1C
Several samples of points (varying in size and configuration) were randomly generated using the Python program 'Points.py'.
An experiment was then run on these samples to compare the efficiency of the two algorithms. 

The results of this experiment were presented in an academic report.

## Part 2
### Problem 2A
A modified version of breadth-first search was utilised to find the length of the shortest path between two given nodes in an unweighted graph.

- **Input:** A .txt file containing;
    - The number of nodes in the graph (line 1)
    - The number of edges in the graph (line 2)
    - The starting node (line 3)
    - The ending node (line 4)
    - The edges in the graph represented by the two adjoining nodes (all subsequent lines)

- **Output:** The length of the shortest path

### Problem 2B
Dijkstra's algorithm was utilised to find the length of the shortest path between two given nodes in a weighted graph.

- **Input:** A .txt file containing;
    - The number of nodes in the graph (line 1)
    - The number of edges in the graph (line 2)
    - The starting node (line 3)
    - The ending node (line 4)
    - The edges in the graph represented by the two adjoining nodes followed by the weight (all subsequent lines)

- **Output:** The length of the shortest path

### Problem 2C
Prim's algorithm was utilised to find the total weight of a minimum spanning tree starting at a given node in a weighted graph.

- **Input:** A .txt file containing;
    - The number of nodes in the graph (line 1)
    - The number of edges in the graph (line 2)
    - The starting node (line 3)
    - The edges in the graph represented by the two adjoining nodes followed by the weight (all subsequent lines)

- **Output:** The total cumulative weight of the minimum spanning tree

### Problem 2D
A modified form of Dijkstra's algorithm was utilised to find the length of the shortest path between two given nodes in a weighted graph. Each edge weight represents a percentage multiplier that can be applied as follows;

$$d(x_0, x_i) = d(x_0, x_{i'}) + d(x_0, x_{i'})  \times d(x_{i'}, x_i) $$

Where $x_0$ is the starting node, $x_i$ is a given node in the path and $x_{i'}$ is the node prior to $x_i$.

- **Input:** Same as Problem 2B (weights are stored as percentages)
- **Output:** The total multiplier generated by the shortest path


## Credits

This assignment built upon skeleton code which was provided by the COMP20007 teaching team and written by Grady Fitzpatrick. Some algorithmic logic was adapted from pseudocode found in COMP20007 lecture slides, assignment specifications and 'Introduction to the Design & Analysis of Algorithms' by Anany Levitin.
